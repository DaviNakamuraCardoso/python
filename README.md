# Scripting
### Automating the boring stuff with simple Scripts

Automating the boring stuff with simple scripting languages such as Perl, Awk and Python and Bash.

## Perl
Perl is a language for getting your job done.
Of course, if your job is programming, you can get your job done with any “com-
plete” computer language, theoretically speaking. But we know from experience
that computer languages differ not so much in what they make possible, but in
what they make easy. At one extreme, the so-called “fourth generation languages”
make it easy to do some things, but nearly impossible to do other things. At the
other extreme, so-called “industrial-strength” languages make it equally difficult
to do almost everything.
Perl is different. In a nutshell, Perl is designed to make the easy jobs easy, without
making the hard jobs impossible.

## Awk
Computer users spend a lot of time doing simple, mechanical data manipula-
tion - changing the format of data, checking its validity, finding items with
some property, adding up numbers, printing reports, and the like. All of these
jobs ought to be mechanized, but it's a real nuisance to have to write a special-
purpose program in a standard language like C or Python each time such a task
comes up.
Awk is a programming language that makes it possible to handle such tasks
with very short programs, often only one or two lines long. An awk program is
a sequence of patterns and actions that tell what to look for in the input data
and what to do when it's found. Awk searches a set of files for lines matched
by any of the patterns; when a matching line is found, the corresponding action
is performed. A pattern can select lines by combinations of regular expressions
and comparison operations on strings, numbers, fields, variables, and array ele-
ments. Actions may perform arbitrary processing on selected lines; the action
language looks like C but there are no declarations, and strings and numbers
are built-in data types.

## Regular Expressions
Pattern matching with Regular Expressions is a feature of all modern scripting languages.


## CSV
The Awk Programming language makes it easy to manipulate tables and CSV files are no exception.
